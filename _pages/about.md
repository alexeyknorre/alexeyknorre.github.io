I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Department of Computer Science at Boston College. I use statistics to study crime, gun violence, homicide, drugs, and victimization. I got my PhD in Criminology at the University of Pennsylvania, where I also obtained my M.A. in Statistics. My research has been published in *Criminology & Public Policy*, *Journal of Criminal Justice*, and *JAMA Network Open*. I currently serve as a managing editor of *Journal of Quantitative Criminology*.

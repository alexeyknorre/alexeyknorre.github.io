I am a PhD candidate of Criminology at [the University of Pennsylvania](https://crim.sas.upenn.edu), where I also obtained my M.A. in Statistics.

I study gun violence and shooting victimization in the United States. I am also interested in victimization surveys, illegal drugs, and post-soviet criminal justice. I am a big fan of R and frequently use it in my work.

	abstract = {Current Russian drug policy is punitive toward people who use drugs. Moreover, criminal justice in Russia is driven by strong organizational incentives to increase performance indicators of police such as clearance rate. Taken together, these might lead to the use of extrajudicial and illegal police practices, as documented by several qualitative studies. In this article, we explore quantitative evidence of such practices, namely, weight anomalies of the seized heroin that result from minimum threshold amounts established by the law. We find significant discontinuities in the weight distribution of seized heroin near minimum threshold amounts. Placebo tests rule out alternative explanations of the discontinuity and show that the most likely source of the revealed discontinuities is police manipulations with seized heroin.},

	abstract = {Since the first emergence of The Silk Road in 2011, a plethora of anonymous online marketplaces have appeared and disappeared. This paper focuses on one such market, Hydra, which was the largest darknet marketplace in Russia until its shutdown in April 2022. This paper describes the features this online platform provided: user feedback, escrow and dispute resolution, and certification of drug quality. Using two datasets containing data scraped from the platform, we analyse the spatial distribution of drug listings as well as the variety of drug types on the platform. We find that 69\% of the Russian population live in a settlement where at least one drug stash was available for purchase from Hydra. Mephedrone, amphetamine, alpha-{PVP}, and {MDMA} accounted for 67\% of unique drug listings. We show that delivery costs comprised a high share of the final price of drugs on Hydra. In addition, examining product feedback we find that user ratings are skewed towards the highest possible rating value, similar to prior findings in relation to clearnet market places. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first quantitative assessment of this marketplace in academic literature.},
